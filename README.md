# Binary Tree to solve MATH Expressions
**Overview**: This code was created to improve my knowledge in **C Language**, **pointers**, **encapsulation** and **data structure**.

## Concept
The idea used *Pile type structure* to construct binary trees based on **()** and **mathematical operators** (the parentheses organize how the tree structure is constructed). The image bellow exemplify this:

## How to Run
Execute *expressionMathBinaryTree.exe*

## Notes
- This code was created based on my native language(pt-br), but I managed to change the commentaries to english. So any question that you have you can enter in contact with me!
